Pull the bag off to the side to avoid making peaks on the top. For the stems, press out a tiny bit of meringue onto the other sheet, then pull the bag straight up. They should resemble candy kisses. Do not worry about making all of the pieces exactly the same. The mushrooms will look more natural if the pieces are different sizes. Dust the mushroom caps lightly with cocoa using a small sifter or strainer.",

It's so worth the wait! I serve it with colcannon, steamed cabbage wedges, braised carrots, and parsnips.

The famous Key lime pie was new to me. It was a friend's best dessert, and he used to buy it from Costco every time we went shopping. I tasted the pie at several places, but they were missing that wow flavor. I kept playing with the recipe and finally got the right flavor. I now live in North Bay, Ontario, where we only get Key limes twice a year, so sometimes I substitute them with fresh lime juice.",

All the veggie prep can be done while the onions and bay leaves are simmering. I do add more broth when the veggies go in. The cabbage will add a significant amount of water but the beef flavor is key. It will freeze great in resealable bags for a quick meal so I normally double the recipe when going to this effort, which in my opinion is well worth it.
